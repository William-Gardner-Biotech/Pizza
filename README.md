My name is William Gardner and I have a passion for pizza. I am always jumping from one hobby to another and Covid lockdown really pushed me in some weird directions. Between lockpicking, pizza making, crab fishing, and freediving; pizza cheffing was the Covid hobby that stuck.

I graduated from UC Davis in 2023 with a major in Biotechnology, emphasizing in Bioinformatics, along with a minor in Economics. My pizza skills were improved as an undergraduate at UC Davis where I would host boardgame nights and test pizza recipes on friends. I was logistics officer in UC Davis Outdoor club, event planner for surf club, and a member of Biotech club. 

Aside from pizza making my other primary interests are data science/programming and surfing. Within data science I have experience working with large biological data sets and am practicing with machine learning in my free time (https://www.kaggle.com/willgardnerbiotech). Finally, you can find me surfing with friends in Santa Cruz all the way north to Bodega Bay when the waves are good. My current favorite surfboard is my 5'4" Almond R-series (named Chippy) which rides like a shortboard but can also paddle into smaller longboard waves.

This is my baby, my first real pizza oven which I bought with my paella money (long story). It is an ooni Karu 12 which has the capability to use both wood or propane as fuel sources. This pizza oven has traveled all across California with me on surf trips and hiking club adventures. It is incredibly portable and easy to clean. I am still mastering the skill of maintaining oven temperature for consistency. Statistically speaking this oven will burn pizzas about 1/10 of the time (I will not consider myself as a human error because I am perfect and always consistent). I am continually collecting data points while I cook to further improve my skills and method. (Refer to data/Pizza_Oven_Karu_12.csv)

Thank you for giving my repository a view and feel free to try my recipes.

All of my recipes are open-sauce!
