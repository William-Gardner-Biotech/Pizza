    Pizza Dough Recipe
</h1>

This recipe has been constantly tweaked and modified since I first began making pizza consistently. There are many factors that go into making a delicious pizza dough. I will try to capture the process that makes my dough so incredibly tasty so you can reproduce it. I also encourage you to personalize this recipe and build upon it as you see fit.

    <center><u>Ingedients:</u></center>
</h2>

    1. 3 & 1/2 cups of flour
    2. 1 & 1/2 cups of water/beer
    3. 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of olive oil
    4. 1 & 1/2 teaspoons of kosher salt
    5. 1 teaspoon active dry yeast
    6. 2 pinches of sugar
    
    * Yield 3 thin crust dough balls

</h2>

1. Begin by mixing the water, olive oil, salt, dry yeast, and sugar together.
    a. The water can be a mixture of both water and beer and I recommend using a 2:1 ration of water to beer. Beer can add very unique flavors to your dough but all parts water works as well.
    b. New York is renowned for it's pizza and some credit their delicious dough with the local New York water. If you are in New York, lucky you, but for the rest of us any old tap water will do the trick.
    c. A classic New York trick is to inverse the temperature f the water with the ambient air temperature outside. On cold days I use warm water and on warm days I use colder water.

2. Wait 5 minutes after combining for the yeast to show signs of life (bubbles).
    a. This is a good rule of thumb especially for older yeast as dead yeast makes a dead dough and a waste of good ingredients and time.
3. Place three cups of flour in a mixing bowl then add your water mixture to the flour.

4. Mix the ingredients together and knead the dough to form a dough ball.
    a. While kneading the dough together your hands will become very sticky, but just add more flour to the mixture. The goal is to find the perfect balance between dough sticking to your hands and flour added.

    b. Kneading the dough will develop the gluten and form a stretchier dough so I always advise kneading by hand. 
    c. A spanish woman taught me to always slam the pizza ball against the table when it is almost done forming. I don't know if this changes the dough but it is fun nonetheless to slam dough against your mixing bowl.

5. Let dough rise before tossing.
    
        If you want to use the dough same day:
            cover and store at room temperature at least 2 hours, ensure dough is rising.
        else: 
            cover and  refrigerate for 24 hours, ensure dough has risen
    
6. Make a pizza!
